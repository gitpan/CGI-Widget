Revision history for Perl extension CGI::Widget.

0.15  Small trimming of HList and ilk.
0.14  Documentation change to reflect Tree::DAG_Node requirement for HList and
      ilk.  HList.t changed to test for this dependency.
0.13  AUTOLOAD is now dynamically selected when CGI::Widget is used as
      an Exporter.  Added HList/Node.pm to the distribution, which was missing
      from v0.12.
0.12  Subclasses of subclasses can now be autoloaded using double-underscore
      notation (when using :standard).  For instance, constructing CGI::Widget::Series
      requires a Series() call, and constructing CGI::Widget::HList::Node requires
      a HList__Node() call.
      Added on-the-fly constructors for the html() methods in Series and HList
0.11  Added an HList subclass, loosely based on Tk::HList, and drawing heavily
      from the Tree::DAG_Node class.
0.10  Added AUTOLOAD support from CGI::Widget for CGI::Widget subclasses.
0.05  0.01 didn't build under perl 5.005_03.
